SVM (Support Vector Machine)
The process of classifying bank notes as authentic or false using numerical characteristics including variance, skewness, kurtosis, and entropy.
Since there were relatively few outliers, I first utilised SVM to identify and eliminate all of the outliers in the dataset for this classification problem.
